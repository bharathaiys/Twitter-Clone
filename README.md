# Twitter Simulator
  
  The project is an implementation of a Twitter Simulator. The problem statement is to implement an engine that (in part II) we paired it up with WebSockets to provide full functionality. The client part (send/receive tweets) and the engine (distribute tweets) were simulated in separate OS processes.
